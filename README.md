# C++ Console Snake GameNo engines. 

No graphics libraries. Just 100% C++ and the Windows Console API.

Welcome to a project that takes it back to the roots. This is the classic Snake game built from scratch, focusing on raw memory management, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and low-level console control.It’s fast, it’s flicker-free, and it’s running entirely in your terminal.

The VisualsIt's not 4K, but it's honest work. The game renders a custom UI frame with live stats.
